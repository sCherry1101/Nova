        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How does the timer work?</h3>
            <p>The timer is a core feature of Nova, allowing you to set focused work intervals. You can start, pause, and reset it. It's designed to help you practice time management techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, breaking down your work into manageable chunks.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are "Quests"?</h3>

            <h3>How do I change my codename?</h3>
